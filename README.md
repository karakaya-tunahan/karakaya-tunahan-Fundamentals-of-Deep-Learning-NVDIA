# Fruits Fresh and Rotten Classification

## Brief:
This project focuses on classifying images of fruits as either fresh or rotten using deep learning techniques. The model was developed using transfer learning and data augmentation to improve performance on the provided dataset. The goal was to achieve a validation accuracy of 92% or higher.
-Utilized a pretrained ImageNet model to enhance the model's ability to identify and classify fruit images.- Applied techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping to increase the variability in the dataset and improve generalization.**** Fine-tuned the model to achieve a high validation accuracy, meeting the course requirements for certification.****

## Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification)

## Library Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras for building the convolutional neural network (CNN)
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data and results
